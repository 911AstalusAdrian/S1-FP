Some of the most interesting game implementations that are worth checking out and playing against

## Battleship (Gruița Marc, group 913)
An implementation of the classical game of Battleships. Since this is not a game of complete information (the 'map' is hidden), mini-max is replaced by a statistics-based approach, where we calculate which squares have the highest chance of having an enemy ship.

## Checkers (Moldovan Teodor, group 915)
An implementation of checkers

## Connect4 (Popa Andrei Calin, group 916)
One of the best implementations of this game, both playwise as well as UI-wise

## Chess (Negrău Mircea, group 915)
One of the chess implementations. Chess remained one of the mosts difficult games that were implemented for FP, given the variety of game pieces, moves and special rules (castling, en passant etc.)

## Battleship (Lazăr Răzvan, group 914)
A second implementation of the classical game of Battleships. Since this is not a game of complete information (the 'map' is hidden), mini-max is replaced by a statistics-based approach, where we calculate which squares have the highest chance of having an enemy ship. Very nice statistical approach handily explained using Excel and graphs!

## Connect4 (Săvin Radu, group 916)
Another very nice implementation of this game, with what was probably the nicest GUI we had to choose from.

## Gomoku (Constantin Marian, group 912)
Also known as five-in-a-row, this game is usually played on a Go board. Minimax works especially well in this kind of game.
