Test results:

    Average number of moves (shots) until game over:

                1000 games      5000 games
    beginner      95.47             NaN
    easy          46.55            46.68
    medium        40.20            39.93
    hard          42.81            40.53

As can be seen in excels.Statistics, while the 'easy' and 'medium' 'algorithms' depend on the luck, being based on randomised
shooting, the 'hard' algorithm is highly dependent on the layout of the ships, favoring the more central layouts
