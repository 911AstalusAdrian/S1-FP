    - Board initially empty ( none in each cell of the matrix --> 6 rows 7 columns)
    - use an input list (you can type in only the column number)
    - the chip is automatcally placed on the first available cell from that column (bottom up)
    - check for win condition after placing the chip
    - if win, display a message and stop the game
    - else, switch to the other player (firstly an input, can try AI)
